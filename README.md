# Hi, I'm Lucascodev! ðŸ‘‹


Welcome to my mvc framework project,
below you will find everything you need to use it,
all the steps will be well explained hope you understand.

Well, to start you need to download the project:


```
git clone https://github.com/lucascodev/
```

Assuming you have your environment configured with *php* and *composer*, 
follow the steps below!

Access the terminal in your project folder and use the composer command to install
autoload and its dependencies:
```
composer install && composer update
```

Create an .env file to add the connection variables:

Example: the **.env** file contains the following variables with your database connection data
```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=username
DB_PASS=password
DB_NAME=mydb
```

Now just turn on your localhost server and test!
Good luck!
